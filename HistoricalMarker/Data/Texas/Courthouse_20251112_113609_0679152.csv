Ruffini recieved a duplicate set of plans for the Tom Green County Courthouse from his brother, Oscar, who had been hired as superintendent of construction for the new courthouse in San Angelo. F. E. was so taken with the design by W. W. Larmour, that he adapted the form to create his plans for the Blanco County Courthouse in Blanco. The design proved so successful, Ruffini quickly presented the plans to two other counties: Callahan and Concho (Dickey, pp. 125-6). Eventually the same plan would be used to construct a total of five courthouses in the state including Sutton and Mills CountiesÔ. Of the five courthouses constructed using the design, three survive: Blanco, Concho, and Sutton Counties'.  The Second Empire styled courthouse was laid out on the traditional cross axial plan with wide corridors dividing the ground floor into four equal quadrants. Offices and storage spaces located in these quadrants were allocated to the County and District Clerks, Sheriff, County Treasurer, Tax Assessor, Surveyor, County Judge and chambers for the Commissioners' Court. Stairways at either side of the east-west hall rose simply to a graceful curve at the top. The second floor was occupied by an imposingly scaled courtroom and several jury rooms.      On the exterior of the two-story stone structure, the walls were constructed with cream-colored ashlar masonry with cut stone quoins and a cut stone stringcourse which separated the two floors and formed a base for the tall narrow window openings.  A wide metal cornice was carried on ornamental brackets.  Above the cornice rested the mansard roof rising in three sections and featuring framed circular dormers and metal trim which contrasted with the cornice.  Mansard pavillions with wrought iron cresting accented the entry bays.     At each elevation the entrances were further emphasized by a triangular pediment.

The log courthouse remained on the square and was used as a residence until 1880 when it was purchased by the Mason family and moved to a new location in Cora where it was incorporated into a larger residence. The structure was modified into a 'dog-trot' plan, with the old courthouse serving as the westernmost room and a breeze-way and slightly larger log room constructed on the east. A second chimney was also added, as well as several additional board 'side rooms'. By 1938, the town of Cora was virtually gone and the Mason House had fallen into severe disrepair. It was purchased that year and moved Lake Eanes where it's new owners hoped to rehabilitate the building and open it to the public. Unfortunately, several modifications were made to the structure without proper documentation, leaving many aspects of the building's 1880's appearance unknown. The rehabilitation of the Mason house was never completed, and by 1963 the building was once again in a state of disrepair. It was purchased by A.P. Burks, who moved it to Comanche. In 1983 the building was moved once again. The 'Old Cora Commission' purchased the building and moved it to the courthouse square in Comanche for use as a museum. It remains there today.","1985:Moved to town square in Comanche and used as museum.- ISTEA Grant - building of an arbor, cement picnic tables, and wheelchair passages to Old Cora; construct and landscape sidewalk separating the square and surrounding highways and streets; addition of plants and an irrigation system.

On the exterior, nothing was left of the classical styling and detailing of the historic building.  In its place was a generic ""modern"" building.  As part of the remodeling program, another horseshoe shaped structure was wrapped around the outer walls of Liberty Hall to make way for more office space. Several stories were added to the top of the original Trost building to house the sheriff's department and the county jail on one side, and the city police and city jail on the other.

The building, formerly occupied by Ben F. Nabers as a store and saloon, was purchased from James S. Lester and William M. Eastland and moved from the present site of the First National Bank to the courthouse square.  The move and repair were conducted by G. S. Kornegay.  Little is known about the building.  The small structure was of wood construction measuring 30 by 16 feet with double front doors and five windows on each of the two longer sides.  Local illustrations of the courthouse depict it as a pier and beam building with a gabled roof and simple steps leading to the front doors.  Described in some accounts as a shanty, the building was not well suited for court proceedings.  In fact, District Court was held in rented quarters and office space for county officials was rented from surrounding businesses.  The courthouse, containing no interior partitions or offices was used for public meetings and as church quarters for several local congregations.

Beale who began construction immediately.  In 1848 the building was accepted by the county.  The two story wood structure had a first floor courtroom 13ft high with the upper story divided into rooms for clerks, the sheriff, and jury rooms.  The building had a small cupola with a bell for which the citizens of La Grange donated $20.00 of the total cost of $100.00.  The courthouse was immediately deemed inadequate by some, but served the county until 1857 when it was replaced by yet another new structure.  It was sold to James Haynie for $1,180.00 and moved to a corner lot at Travis and Washington streets.  Here it served many purposes including a grocery store and, near the turn of the century, as print shop for Judge A. Haidusek's newspaper Svoboda.

Two  12 over 12 double hung windows with stone lintels and sills flanked the doors on each floor.  The side facades had three pairs of the same windows per floor.  The relatively wide space between the pairs allowed room for two chimneys which projected slightly above the parapet.   The rear facade of the building is not depicted in any photographs but appears to have a small, one story building attached.          The large tower rose centrally from a low hipped roof.  The tower's lower section was square and symmetrical tapering slightly toward the top.  Approximately 10 to 15 feet in height, this tower section was board and batten and was topped by a small simple cornice.  A rectangular ventilator penetrated the front facade just above the roof line.  The upper section of the tower was octagonal in shape with each side having a shuttered or louvered opening flanked by wood pilasters.  The tower was topped with another simple crown moulding and finally by a small dome with a wind vane.  The tower's upper section housed a bell for which the county paid $300.00.  At some point a clock was added to the lower section of the tower with the face displayed on the front facade.        The basement and first floor housed county offices and the second floor the courtroom. Embellishments were meager.

The two story courthouse was constructed of native lumber and hewn by hand. The weather boards were handmade out of post oak (Boethel, p.3). In 1852, the county seat was moved to Hallettsville. Some time during the 1850's, E. H. Nelson and his wife, established Nelson Academy, using this courthouse to house some of the academy's borders.

The building was not completed until November of 1875 even though the first materials for the structure arrived in January of 1874.  In the interim, court was held in the Riemenschneider's Furniture House. When finally built, the courthouse was a two story stone building with a shingle roof.. In 1897, it was deemed unfit and demolished in order to make room for the present courthouse (Boethel). It was decided that the timber from this courthouse would be reserved to build bridges in Lavaca County. Most of the lumber was used to construct a bridge over Rockaway Branch, east of town. Conflicting reports state that the demolition of this courthouse was started by the General Contractor of the present courthouse, A. T. Lucas,  and the remaining lumber and stone were bought by Friench Simpson and M. A. McKnight for $400.00 (Kubicek, p. 8-9); however, another reports states that the courthouse was demolished and bought by Jonathan Speary for $330.00 (Boethel).After the demolition of the courthouse, most of the county offices were relocated to the Opera House and the Elstner building (Boethel). The vault from the County Clerk's office was moved to the southwest corner of the courthouse yard. A temporary building built for the County Clerk's office was constructed around the vault and served as that office for 20 months. The building was 22x44 feet with 12 foot walls, 6 windows and 1 door. The front 24 feet of the building was floored and the entire building weather boarded. The Clerk's office was constructed for $48.00 by T. B. Dowling (Kubicek, p. 9 & 11). The temporary County Clerk's office was dismantled after the completion of the present courthouse and rebuilt by S. J. Townsend at the County Poor Farm for a sum of $24.00 (p.43).  There, the old County Clerk's building served as a kitchen and dining room with a small corner of the building designated as a holding room for insane persons (p. 52). The vault was once again dismantled and reassembled in the new District Clerks office on the second floor of the new courthouse for a sum of $350.00(p. 34 & 43) and the iron left over from the old iron vault was sold at  a public auction (P. 52).",1894: repairs made to courthouse and a belfry added to the roof.1897: demolished.1897: temporary building constructed for county clerk.Other county offices spread around town in rented facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,False,,"""Lavaca County Seats and Their Courthouses"" by Paul C.

3029,McCulloch County Courthouse (1877),McCulloch,160,,,,razed 1899,,1878-1899,1877,,John McDonald,Italianate influenced,,,False,,False,,,False,False,"McCulloch County was named in honor of Benjamin McCulloch, whose distinguished career included service as a Texas Ranger, United States marshal, and brigadier general in the Confederate Army. He participated in the Texas Revolution, and served with Sam Houston in the Battle of San Jacinto. In 1862, during the American Civil War, General McCulloch was killed in the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas. McCulloch County was carved out of Bexar District by the Sixth Legislature in 1856. There were enough settlers to fill only a few county offices throughout the 1860s, but post-war westward emigration from the old Confederate states swelled the population of the Texas frontier. By 1876, all county positions had been filled. That same year, Henry and Nancy Fulcher and Thomas E. Smith donated 160 acres of land to McCulloch County and proposed they become the site of the new county seat. The county held an election and only nineteen votes were cast in favor of the site. However, in July, County Surveyor A.J. Storm surveyed the site and charted the town. The court instructed him to lay out two hundred foot square blocks, including the town square, and eighty foot wide streets (Barfoot, 37-38).  Until a suitable courthouse could be built, the county rented a house from Mr. J. A. Brooke to use as temporary office space. In May 1877, the county accepted the only bid for the construction of the courthouse and jail. John McDonald, a builder from Austin, immediately began construction. The foundations were laid by mid-July, but by the time the four lower rooms of the courthouse were finished in January 1878, the plaster had already begun to crack (Barfoot, 39, 43-45.) John McDonald's sandstone courthouse was a vernacular building with Italianate influences, as seen in its heavy cornice and window treatment. A central octagonal cupola with eight medallions, each decorated by a painted star, perched above its two stories, and two chimneys topped the shallow-pitched hip roof on the north side. Four pediments delineated the entrances on each side. Accented keystones were placed above the entrances and five windows of each facade. The first floor arches were semi-circular, while those in the second floor were rounded. All the windows were double hung with exterior shutters.  Only two years after its construction, the courthouse was plagued with expensive structural problems. Although the county had received money to solve the drainage problems in the square, by November it had become apparent that a repair fund was necessary. Iron rods capped with iron stars were necessary to reinforce the building and prevent its spreading. In 1883, a fence was built around the courthouse and two cisterns were added to the square; shade trees were planted in 1886, and in 1891, a fireproof vault was added (Barfoot 48-50). By the end of the decade, county officials decided the courthouse was beyond repair. On May 10, 1899, the court voted to demolish the courthouse and to build a new one on the site.

The design proved so successful, Ruffini quickly presented the plans to two other counties: Callahan and Concho (Dickey, pp. 125-6). After F. E. Ruffini's death in 1885, Oscar submitted the plans to secure courthouse commissions in Sutton and Mills Counties. Of the five courthouses constructed using the design, three survive: Blanco, Concho, and Sutton Counties'. The Second Empire styled courthouse was laid out on the traditional cross axial plan with wide corridors dividing the ground floor into four equal quadrants. Offices and storage spaces located in these quadrants were allocated to the County and District Clerks, Sheriff, County Treasurer, Tax Assessor, Surveyor, County Judge and chambers for the Commissioners' Court. Stairways at either side of the east-west hall rose simply to a graceful curve at the top. The second floor was occupied by an imposingly scaled courtroom and several jury rooms.      On the exterior of the two-story stone structure, the walls were constructed with cream-colored ashlar masonry with cut stone quoins and a cut stone stringcourse which separated the two floors and formed a base for the tall narrow window openings.  A wide metal cornice was carried on ornamental brackets.  Above the cornice rested the mansard roof rising in three sections and featuring framed circular dormers and metal trim which contrasted with the cornice.  Mansard pavillions with wrought iron cresting accented the entry bays.     At each elevation the entrances were further emphasized by a triangular pediment.

The building was covered with moderately pitched gable roofs, and had numerous doors and double hung windows facing onto the surrounding landscape. (Edwards, 36) The courthouse and jail occupied the current site of the Jeff Davis County Courthouse and were accepted by the county on May 29th. The Presidio courthouse was nicknamed the 'Bat Cave Courthouse.' It is uncertain whether this name was inherited from the previous jail which was actually just a bat infested cellar under a house or whether the name refers to the jail built beneath the sheriff's office in the new courthouse, accessible only from a trap door in the floor. In the county history by Cecilia Thompson, a vivid 1880 description from an unknown source is given: The jail at Fort Davis was of Mexican model, and was little less than a dungeon. The main building was a square, adobe structure, with the rooms in the center and doors opening on the outside into the courtyard. The jail was in one corner of the building, and blasted out of the solid rock to a proper depth, then covered over the top by strong timbers securely fastened. The egress was a trap door. No light was there. And into this place of utter darkness the captured outlaws were placed. (Thompson, vol. 1, 156) By May of 1883, county officials decided that the 1880 courthouse was already unfit for use. The Commissioners voted to advertise for the location and construction of a new courthouse and jail in the Apache Rocket, a Fort Davis newspaper. In June of that year, the court deemed the present building insufficient and unfit for use, and condemned the structure. They declared, 'Imperative necessity exists for the building of a new courthouse and jail.' (Commissioner's Court Minutes, 6/11/1883) Again the court advertised in the local newspaper as well as the San Antonio Express. The Commissioners requested: 'Said courthouse to be two stories high and the jail to be strong and durable, with all modern improvements and one story high. The courthouse to have a large room upstairs for the purposes of a courtroom and also two rooms for jury rooms. The lower story to be cut up into offices for the different county officers. Said building to have proper ventilation and communication- Said buildings to be of rock and the jail of large rock. Said buildings not to exceed $30,000 in cost.' The bids were opened August 13, 1883. The following day all of the bids for the construction of a new courthouse and jail were rejected. No further mention of new court facilities is made in the records until the county seat was relocated to Marfa in 1885. It is likely that this building later became the first courthouse for Jeff Davis County when it was organized around Fort Davis in 1887.

3030,Randall County Courthouse (1889),Randall,191,,,,razed 1965,,1889-1909,1889,Joseph Tracy Service,Joseph Tracy Service,Second Empire,,,False,,False,,,False,False,"On August 13, 1889, the first Commissioner's Court of Randall County ordered advertisements for bids for the construction of a new courthouse. The building was to be of frame construction, about 50 feet wide and 45 feet deep, two stories high, and set on a good stone foundation. The lower story would be divided by a hall with three offices on either side, and the upper was to have a large courtroom and two jury rooms. The cost of the structure was not to exceed 6,000 dollars. The contract was awarded on September 10th to J. T. Service for 8,200 dollars and construction was started immediately. The courthouse constructed in Canyon by Service was not the county's first. A temporary 20 by 30 foot two room shack was constructed across from the square to house records until the new courthouse was completed. After it was vacated by the county, the temporary building became Randall County's first school.  The second courthouse appears to have been built according to county specifications. Constructed in the Second Empire style, the building had a Mansard roof with two arched dormer windows per side. The transition between the metal shingled Mansard roof and the flat metal roof behind was marked by decorative wrought-iron cresting. The building's front facade was emphasized by a truncated tower with matching mansard roof and cresting. The tower's front was adorned with fish scale shingles and bulls-eye window with its sides and rear being almost entirely enveloped by the building's roofline. Two brick chimneys per side projected from the roof of the side facades just above the cornice line. The four facades were quite similar with a bracketed Italianate cornice and polychromatic paint scheme. Alternating single and paired pedimented two over two double hung windows penetrated each facade with a matching transomed double entrance door centrally placed at the building's front. Siding was wood clapboard with a 4 to 5 foot wide strip of fish scale shingles marking the transition between the first and second floors. Sometime around 1902 the mansard roof and tower were removed in favor of a hipped roof with a central tower. This change was presumably made to relieve persistent leak problems in the courthouse's flat metal roof. The courthouse served many functions for the citizens of Randall County. In addition to county business, the building housed church functions, general assemblies, lectures and weekend dances.

The building was constructed in a design typical of courthouses of the period. The two story wood structure was 40 by 40 feet with centrally placed entrances on all four sides. Intersecting corridors on the first floor divided it into four equal quadrants, each with one office. The second floor was entirely dedicated to the courtroom. Wise county's first courthouse constructed especially for that purpose was built almost entirely of wood. The four facades were identical with wood clapboard siding, a central, double-doored entrance on the first floor with a 6 pane divided light transom, flanked by 6 over 6 double hung windows. On the second floor directly above these openings three equally spaced 6 over 6 double hung windows provided light and ventilation to the courtroom. Some of the building's windows appear to have been shuttered. Trim consisted of a simple wood cornice and wide planks forming corner trim and a horizontal band between the soffit and third floor windows. The building had a hipped roof which was penetrated by at least three masonry chimneys.    The courthouse provided ample space for county business with enough room left over for rental space. Tenants in the building included lawyers, the town's first photo gallery, and the first newspaper.  The building burned on November, 26 1881.

It met the ground with a minimal base with each facade arranged in a series of bays; 5 bays on the front and rear facades, 3 on the sides. Entrances on each facade were emphasized by the projection of the central bay and were accented by a shallow bracketed balcony above. The projecting entry of the main facade continued upward to create a dominant central tower with a large domed mansard roof with projecting clock dormers on each side. The remaining three entry bays were topped with ornate pediments flanked by elaborate chimney tops which projected through the roof just behind the bracketed cornice line. The roof was constructed with two tiers, the lower being more steeply pitched than the upper, and was embellished with roof cresting at the corners and on the top of the tower. Unfortunately, the fire which destroyed the previous courthouse did not inspire the county to construct a fire resistant building. Protection against fire was provided by a guard who watched the building at night. Before long, the guard seemed unnecessary and his protection was removed. Wise County's fourth courthouse burned on the night of January 12, 1895. The fire didn't just destroy the courthouse, it started a controversy over the location of the county seat. An election in November of 1885 overwhelmingly reaffirmed Decatur as the permanent county seat. Ironically, construction of the new courthouse in the middle of the square began in June, five months before the election was held.	razed by fire 1895
